## Main ideas
Submission for The Gemma 3n Impact Challenge

* Private first camera surveillance 
* Upload lists of cameras ip and connection 
* Subscribe to email notifications 
* Test on the dataset - with true labels 
* Fastapi stream service, pick random from dataset etc 
* Download report 

* Make search easy, classify objects or specific parts, there was a dog, query with natural language 
* Add cammera location programmatically, and the edge detects for fast inference 
* Prompt engineer and fine-tuned 
* On premise, reducing crime is the main focus of governments budgets, locally preserving privacy 
* Next step is facial detection, missing people d etection 
* Highly unstructured data 
* OLlama to run locally and in parallel

1. Data set
2. Download and host model play with output 
3. Check benchmark, and create benchmark pipeline
